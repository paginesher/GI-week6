// HARD: Create two buttons, one that when clicked turns the background of the body red. The 
// other, when clicked, turns the body's background color white. Each of the background colors 
// should be defined as class styles and when the buttons are pushed the body's classList is 
// updated to include the correct class for the background. 
// Create a single function that takes an input className and updates the body's classList to 
// ONLY include that className
// *Note: Check Canvas for the starter code needed for this exercise. The starter code will be 
// located in a folder named hard_js. 
window.updateBackground = function(className) {
    let body = document.querySelector("body")
    body.className = ""
    body.classList.add(className)
